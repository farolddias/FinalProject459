#Summary
The main objective of this final project report was to analyze two input files containing a number of
spheres and a mesh, which is simply a collection of triangles, and carry out a collision detection step.
After working on the project, I learned that this was a very significant step in creating video games and
various simulations. Some of the code used in the primary code was not compatible with the compiler on
my home machine which was a Windows device and several challenges with other compilers. I tested
my program on Euler to make sure it ran smoothly in the end.
